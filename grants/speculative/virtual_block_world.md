# Virtual Block World

## VBW Description
  * By virtue of Substrate / Polkadot's ability it is efficient to create a virtual world, which all data is put on the blockchain.The data of virtual world on chain is more than a type of number, but a 3D space what can be walked in ,just like a game.This kind of data should be called 'digital assets'.
  * In VBW (virtul block world),data on chain is a 3D space,which is more interestring than just numbers.It is a new way to explore data on chain.In this way, the ecosystem is extended from 2D to 3D and extended from coins to assets.
  * VBW benefits from Substrate / Polkadot's super convenience, special format of 3D object will be stored on chain by using Substrate's pallet, which is simple, open and cross platform. For example, such data as '[[4,0.2,3],[11,14,1.5],[0,0,0],12,[]]' will be rendered as a wall in VBW application.In this way, we can put the whole game on chain.
  * The concept of "digital assets" makes us very excited. Imagine that,I can created a "Fun Park" in the virtual world,which may attract many people to explore, also may earn a lot of coins for me. What's more exciting is that I can pass on this paradise to my daughter,so the data become a real asset. It is exciting to create such worlds.

  * Now,I have finished the demo base on PHP / JS , you can test here:

  * The main framework is basically put on Substrate / Polkadot, you can review here.

## Development Roadmap

### Milestone 1 — Trigger and Gift Module — 2 month — $20,000

* We will deliver a working module, along with a simple tutorial that explains how Trigger and Gift can work together to create simple game, such as room escape.Once the node is up, it will be possible to send test transactions that will show how the new functionality works.
* Gift data format definition and Trigger datt format definition.
* Gift module functions: gift publish, gift buy,gift adopt, gift list. 
* Trigger module functions:trigger create, trigger event. 
* We will create a play land in VBW,to show how Gift and Trigger work together. Details as follow:
  * Trigger events: in,out,hold. 
  * Trigger functions:check permit,transfer,check gift
  * When you have the specified Gift, you can enter the room through Trigger verification.
* The code will have proper unit-test coverage to ensure functionality and robustness.
* We will build a Docker image with (e.g.) our Substrate chain, demonstrating its functionality.
* We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial describing how the software can be used and tested.

### Milestone 2 — Tree Module — 1 month — $10,000

* We will deliver a working module of Tree to verify the impact of time on digital assets. Once the node is up, it will be possible to send test transactions that will show how the new functionality works.
* We will create a forest in VBW to show the impaction of time.The shape of trees varies with the time they growing up.
* Gift module functions: tree create, tree growing, trigger format definition.
* The code will have proper unit-test coverage to ensure functionality and robustness.
* We will build a Docker image with (e.g.) our Substrate chain, demonstrating its functionality.
* We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial describing how the software can be used and tested.



## Future Plans
* Finally,we will create a virtual world which the content is created by users.
* More functions will be migrated to new system, such as Chord Autobuild System , 3D objects animation, image to lattice.
